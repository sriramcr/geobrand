This project basically shows all local providers (for a hub) on Google Map. The Info window contains ratings and reviews for 
the local provider. 

It uses Nodejs, express, ejs, google map geocoding apis, postgresql.

Please rename hub1.js to hub.js and provide the database properties accordingly to access a db.

It also uses BVL apis, dev-apis and common library. You will have to include them (or) talk to BVL team to get access to those files/libraries.
